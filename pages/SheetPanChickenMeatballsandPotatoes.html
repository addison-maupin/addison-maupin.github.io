        <h3>Addi's Notes:</h3>
        <p> Easy week night meal that makes about 4 servings. I normally do not have Greek seasoning so just use oregano. The first time I made this, I
        replaced the potatoes with roasted zucchini but the meal was not very filling, so next time I will do a mix
        of roast potatoes and veggies. I also like to serve this on a bed of lettuce with tzatziki, parsley, and a little lemon.</p>
