    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li>Season chicken breast with salt and pepper then drench both sides in flour, shaking off excess. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in skillet on medium high, when oil is shimmering, add the sliced mushrooms and stir gently. Leave the mushrooms undisturbed until they stop steaming. Sautee until golden then set aside.</li>
            <li>Add more oil then add the chicken breast and cook undisturbed until golden brown. Turn the chicken and continue to cook. Internal temperature should be 160F. Once cooked, set aside and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Turn heat down and add more fat if needed. Heat until shimmering then add garlic (or shallot). Cook until aromatic (not brown!). Add the wine and scrape the brown bits off the pan. Reduce until most of the wine has evaporated then add the stock and reduce the liquid by half.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium low and add the cold butter. Whisk continuously to emulsify. Add lemon juice, zest, and capers and combine well. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Return chicken and mushrooms to the pan, spooning sauce over both sides of the chicken for about two minutes.</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley and lemon wedges.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Addi's Notes:</h3>
        <p> I learned this recipe from a cooking class I took. It was delicious but I was shocked by the amount of butter in the sauce. A fancy meal for a fun occasion but not a good every day meal!</p>
