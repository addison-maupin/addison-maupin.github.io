    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook sphagetti in generously salted water and reserve some water for the sauce.</li>
        <li>While pasta is cooking, add pancetta to a cast iron and cook until the edges just begin to crisp (can add oil if necessary). Turn off heat.</li>
        <li>Mix eggs, cheese, pepper, and parsley in a serving bowl until smooth. To make the carbonara extra creamy, you can add 1 cup pasta water to this mixture as well.</li>

        <li>Add the egg mixture to the pan (no heat!!!) and toss quickly.</li>

        <h3>Addi's Notes:</h3>
        <p> Perhaps my mother's most treasured recipe, I still struggle to make this. I often cook the eggs on accident. Still delicious but definitely be careful with temperatures and mix the pasta as quickly as possible.  </p>
