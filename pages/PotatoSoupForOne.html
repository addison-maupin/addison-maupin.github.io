        <h3>Addi's Notes:</h3>
        <p> It is very sad having to make potato soup for one person but this recipe is fast and easy! Makes two servings and would be easy to double if you want more. For more flavour, cook your own bacon in the pan and then saute the garlic and onion. I normally never have bacon, so I just top with green onions and cheese.</p>
